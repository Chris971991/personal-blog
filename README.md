A personal blog site commissioned by Andrew Parkinson

## Commission description

### Make me a custom blog, please

I’ve tried wordpress and wasn’t happy with the lack of customizability and clunky plugins. I need a functional blog site that will have:

- A Home page with feed of blogs, showing newest at the top. You’ll want to limit how many it displays in case I decide to post hundreds.
- An About me section to host my resume and a small, plain text blurb. This can be hardcoded.
- A log in page (no signups or registration needed) username and password to be hardcoded into the database in a “users” table. Needs to compare the username and password with the live username and password that it gets from the database.
- An Admin page to be able to list blogs and a way to create, read, update and delete blog entries
- A page to edit blog entries, blogs only need to be plain text with a single image and a heading. No additional formatting is required.
- A way to edit the About me page.

The blog will need to be backed by a database of your choice (whatever you want to learn there’s no wrong answer)
Tables It will need:

- Blogs [Id(key, int), title(string), content(string), image(serialized data?), datetime(datetime)]
- Users [Id(key, int), username(string), password(string)]

I trust you for the design, get as basic or as creative as you like, but I want this to be a legitimate and somewhat professional site, please.

I don’t want to spend more than $25 per month for hosting, you’ll need to figure out how to host it and who with.

Ask me for more information, clarification when you need it!
